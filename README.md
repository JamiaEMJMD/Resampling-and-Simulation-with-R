# Resampling-and-Simulation-with-R
Welcome to the "Resampling-and-Simulation-with-R" repository! This repository a collection of hands-on exercises and solutions of resampling methods, including parametric and non-parametric bootstrapping and permutation tests, using the R programming language. This repository will provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to use these powerful resampling methods to analyze and interpret your data. So, you can explore this repository and discover how resampling and simulation with R can enhance your data analysis toolkit.
