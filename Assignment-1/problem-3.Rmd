#Problem-3:Assume that during a three-hour period spent outside, a person
#recorded the temperature, the amount of time they mowed the
#grass, and their water consumption. The experiment was conducted
#on 7 randomly selected days during the summer. 

#(a) Fit the Water Consumption as a linear function of the Temperature
#(T) and the Time mowing the grass (TMG) by
#means of a multiple regression model. Hint: Use function
#lm in R.
