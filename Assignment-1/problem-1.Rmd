#exercise:1. Remember one of the examples presented in class: 

#The first row is chest circumference (in inches) of five subjects. 
#Let us call this X. 
#The second row is the respective total volumes of air that can be breathed in
#and out in one minute (in liters) for the same five subjects. Let us call this Y.
#X: 39, 29, 60, 40, 32
#Y: 11, 5, 20, 8, 6

#Download the package combinat in order to use the function permn().
#Perform an exact test for H0 : ρ = 0 against H1 : ρ > 0.
#Use Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient as well
```


#Answer: suppose,
##The null hypothesis is, H0: rho = 0 (i.e X and Y are not correlated) 
##The Alternative hypothesis is,H1: rho>0 (i.e X and Y are positively correlated)

x= c(39,29,60,40,32)
y= c(11,5,20,8,6)
sttrue1= cor(x,y,method= "pearson") #taking statistic as the Pearson correlation coefficient
sttrue1
sttrue2= cor(x,y,method= "spearman") #taking statistic as the spearman correlation coefficient

n=length(y)
nr=fact(n) #number of rearrangements to be examined 
st1=numeric(nr)
st2=numeric(nr)
cnt1=0 #for initiating counting
cnt2=0
d=permn(y) #Permuting randomly the Y column leaving the X fixed
for (i in 1:nr)
  { st1[i]<-cor(d[[i]],x,method= "pearson") 
  if (st1[i] >=sttrue1)cnt1=cnt1+1 #comparing the true statistic and the evaluated statistic
  
  st2[i]<-cor(d[[i]],x,method= "spearman") 
  if (st2[i] >=sttrue2)cnt2=cnt2+1 #comparing the true statistic and the evaluated statistic
        
  } 
p_value1<-cnt1/nr #pvalue(using pearson)
p_value1

p_value2<-cnt2/nr #pvalue(using spearman)
p_value2

hist(st1)
points(sttrue1,0,pch = 16,
       col = "blue")

hist(st2)
points(sttrue2,0,pch = 16,
       col = "red")

#in both cases,since the p-value is lower than 0.05,we have lower evidence to support the null hypothesis
#therefore,the null hypothesis is rejected,so we can conclude that
#Chest circumference and volume of air are positively correlated
