#1.How the Rent of the houses varies according to various variables such as: the Number of Bedrooms and Hall/Kitchen areas (BHK),City, and Furnishing status.

#5.	i)What is a better measure for typical rent in India for both 2-room and 3-room houses?


```{r}

#select rent data according to the no. of rooms
house_rent<- house %>% select("BHK","Rent") 
#select rent data for 2 rooms house
house_rent_2room <- house_rent[house_rent$BHK=="2",] 
#select rent data for 3 rooms house
house_rent_3room<- house_rent[house_rent$BHK=="3",] 

```

```{r}
hist(house_rent_2room$Rent)
hist(house_rent_3room$Rent)
#Since in both of our cases, we donâ€™t have any outliers,
#we will use mean as the measure for typical rents
```
#5.ii)	Use bootstrap techniques to estimate the mean rental price for the whole population in India

```{r}

  # Specify the variable of interest

  # Generate 10000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  # Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")
  
# View its structure
str(rent_mean2)

# Plot the rent_mean2 statistic
ggplot(rent_mean2, aes(x=stat)) +
  # Make it a histogram with a binwidth of 50
  geom_histogram(binwidth=50) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of 2-room house ")

```



```{r}
# Similarly,generate bootstrap distribution of means for 3-room houses:
set.seed(1)

  # Specify the variable of interest
